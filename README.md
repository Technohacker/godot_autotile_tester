Tests your autotiles for completeness by using it in a tilemap pattern which uses all tiles in the autotile. Currently works with 3x3 (minimal) autotiles.

## Usage
Copy the addons/ folder to your project and enable the plugin in Project Settings. Once done, select your TileSet resource and click on the Test Autotiles button in the Inspector
